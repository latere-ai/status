# Usage: commit-history.sh DIR COMMAND [ARG...]
#
# DIR is a checkout of the history branch. Runs COMMAND (the probe, which
# writes into DIR), commits what changed, and pushes. If another run pushed
# first, it rebases onto that push and tries again. When the rebase itself
# conflicts, which happens when two runs edited the same day file, it
# discards its local commit, takes the remote branch as it is and runs
# COMMAND again. It never force-pushes, so no one's history is overwritten.
